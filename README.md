# Analysis of NYC Citibike Data
The goal of this analysis is to show viability for a Bike Share venture in Des Moines, Iowa, based on data from Citibike, a bike share company in New York City. This presentation will answer the general questions about use of the Bike Share service by gender, times when bikes are most frequently in use, and the difference between subscription users and one time app use.

### Data Source
The data shown here was obtained from Citybike, a Bike Share company in New York City. The data shown is that of a single month, August of 2019.

### Results
*A total of 2,344,244 rides were logged in August of 2019. NOTE: The population of NYC in 2019 was approximately 15 times that of Des Moines, Iowa. This must be kept in mind when looking at the specific numbers involved in this data, although general trends may be informative. 

*The breakdown of users between service subscribers and single use customer is approximately 4 to 1, with subscribers in the vast majority of users of the bike share service

*lowest use hours for the service, and therefore times most convenient for bike pick up and maintenance, would be between the hours of 2 and 5 AM.

*The image below shows use of citibikes grouped by gender, day, and time. We can see a trend to early morning and late afternoon commuting hours for usage, as well as a somewhat surprising trend of male users outnumbering female. The darker red signifies the largest number of users, while a lighter shade indicates lighter usage for that group and time slot.

*The next image shows trips grouped by gender and duration. Again, we see the trend to commuting times and male users. We can also see that shorter trip times are more common, reinforcing the idea that commuter use is heavy for this service.

*The following image shows bike use grouped by gender and user type (subscriber vs customer). Here, we can see that subscribers are definitely the majority of users of the service. This is an important detail as the Bike Share start up in Des Moines will want to target advertising to encourage subscriber use rather than casual occasional use of the application.

*The image below shows trips by duration and continues to emphasize that shorter trip times are more common, possibly due to many riders utilizing the bike share service for communting purposes. We should bear in mind that this might be very specific to the NYC market. More investigation of this will be important as we plan for the Des Moines venture.

*This final image shows a heat map reflecting day and time usage of the service. Again, we see commuting times most popular on the weekdays, while weekend use is spread more evenly throughout the day, possibly pointing to a different type of user on the weekends.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The data here shows that bike share can be popular and widely used in urban areas and supports the venture of beginning such a service in Des Moines. However, some points must be considered. 
*Des Moines is a smaller city with a very different transportation culture. Driving is easier and entrenched and fewer workers are liable to be looking for alternative ways of commuting. Usage will most likely be a mix of tourism, commuting and other convenience usage. The commuter trends we see in the NYC data may not be representative of a city like Des Moines.  
*As noted earlier, Des Moines is a much smaller city. Start up for this venture must take that difference into account when planning for numbers of bikes, staitions, etc.
*Touristic biking is likely to be a much larger market in Des Moines, a city with a bike culture and lots of walking and biking trails in the metro area. Although subscription use of this service is likely to be a profitable aspect of the business, tourist trade ( usually one time or short term users) will definitley be an important part of the equation. Advertising through tourist websites, hotels, and other travel hubs will be important. Short term or limited memberships or subscriptions might be an avenue to explore.
